# Email Client

This project models an email system using Java OOP framework and JavaGUI with a focus on UML design.

## Description

The system includes various features typical to any email client such as login, compose/send email, view inbox/email, delete email, and search emails. For purposes of demonstration, we limited sending and receiving demonstration to two email accounts (instructions listed below). The user can only login with the listed information. The user must send emails between the two accounts in order to view that email in the other account's inbox; if an alternative email address is entered, the email  will be "sent," but the user won't be able to view it from the receiving-end.

## Instructions

When logging in, use this information:
Account 1 (email address, password): guest1@gmail.com, OOP1
Account 2 (email address, password): guest2@nyu.edu, OOP2
